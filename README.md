# Finance-Model

 This project is a comprehensive financial model for a small company, built using historical Balance Sheet data from 2014–2016. The data was cleaned and structured for analysis, enabling the creation of three forecasting scenarios (worst, base, and best case) for 2017–2021. The model includes a full P&L, Balance Sheet, Fixed Asset Roll Forward, Equity Schedule, and Cash Flow Statement. This project demonstrates financial modeling techniques for forecasting and scenario analysis.
